description: During the American Civil War, many teenage boys braved the battlefield
  in service to their country. That's exactly what the spirited young protagonist
  at the center of Frank on a Gun-Boat decides to do when his cousin Archie asks him
  to join up. Though barely old enough to fend for themselves, the duo sets off to
  join the naval forces that have gathered to fend off the rebels. Will they survive
  the conflict and make it to manhood? Read Frank on a Gun-Boat to find out.
